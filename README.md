## Project Overview

Pet Simulation is a virtual pet care application developed using **Java and JavaFX**. The application simulates two pets—a **dog and a cat**—allowing users to interact with them through actions such as **eat, sleep, play, and clean**.

The system dynamically updates pet states like hunger, happiness, and energy based on user interactions, providing a realistic and interactive simulation experience.

## Key Features

- Virtual pet simulation with dog and cat  
- Interactive actions: eat, sleep, play, and clean  
- Real-time pet state management  
- JavaFX-based graphical user interface  
- User-driven interaction system  
- Simple and intuitive UI design  
- Complete and playable simulation  

---

## Gameplay Mechanics

- User selects either dog or cat  
- Each action affects pet states differently  
- Neglecting actions reduces pet happiness or energy  
- Balanced care keeps pets healthy and active  
- Simulation responds dynamically to user choices  

---

## Design Philosophy

Pet Simulation is designed to keep interactions simple while modeling realistic pet behavior. The focus is on clarity, responsiveness, and meaningful feedback through visible state changes.

The application encourages logical thinking and responsible interaction while maintaining an engaging user experience.

---

## Technical Highlights

- Object-oriented programming using Java  
- JavaFX for UI and event handling  
- State-based logic for pet behavior  
- Modular class design for pets and actions  
- Clean and maintainable code structure  

---

## Current Status

- Dog and cat fully implemented  
- All core actions functional  
- JavaFX UI completed  
- Simulation logic finalized  
- Project completed with scope for future enhancements
